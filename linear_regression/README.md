<h1><b> Recap </b><h1>
<p>
In this lesson, you were introduced to linear models. Specifically, you saw: <br>
    * <b>Gradient Descent</b> as a method to optimize your linear models.<br>
    * <b>Multiple Linear Regression</b> as a technique for when you are comparing<br>
    than two variables<b>
    * <b>Polynomial Regression</b> for relationships between variables that aren't linear.<br>
    * <b>Regularization</b> as a technique to assure that your models will not only fit<br>
    to the data available, but also extend to new situations.<br>
<p>
<h1><b> Outro </b><h1>
<p>
In this lesson, you were predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is<br>
often just condidered a <strong>Regression</strong> problem.
