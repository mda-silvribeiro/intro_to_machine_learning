# The Absolute Trick
# The Absolut Trick is a method for moving the line closer to a point, and looks like this:

#   y = (w1 + pα)x + (w2 + α)
#   p = the horizontal distance to the point
#   α = (pronounced alpha) is what is referred to as the learning rate



#                         | (y)
#                         |   *(p, q)
#                         |
#                         |
#                         |
#                         |                       (x)
# -------------------------------------------------->
#                         |
#                         |
#                         |

#   α, the leraning rate, is a small number whose sign(+ or -)depends on if the point is above or below the line
